打开PythonShell, 输入import this。 回车，输出结果：

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.

Explicit is better than implicit.

Simple is better than complex.

Complex is better than complicated.

Flat is better than nested.

Sparse is better than dense.

Readability counts.

Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.

Although practicality beats purity.

Errors should never pass silently.

Unless explicitly silenced.

In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.

There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.

Now is better than never.

Although never is often better than *right now.*

If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.

If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.

Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!

大意就是用”Python之禅“(Python之道)解释了Python的特点：美观、简单、可读和实用，拒绝复杂或模糊。

程序员这种古代炼金术士一般的黑科技兵种要是文艺起来简直各种挡不住。

敬光荣的开源。

敬伟大的Github。

敬写诗的炼金术士。

以上。

P.S 顺手贴一下另一位炼金术士@ZhengZhong的作品：

Java

纷乱的实现，被精心埋藏在简单的接口下边

迷茫的程序员，迷失在自己建造的工厂里面

C++

回忆是一枚失落的指针

往昔是片永无法删除的内存

Python

是谁说所有的问题都应该只有一个答案

我们该如何面对这纷纷扰扰的异常
